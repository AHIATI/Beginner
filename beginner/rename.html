        In the intricate tapestry of human experience, stress is a pervasive thread that weaves its way through every aspect of our lives.

Stress is the body's natural response to change, a primal alarm that sounds when we perceive danger, uncertainty, or pressure. It's a complex phenomenon that can arise from various sources, including our environment, relationships, thoughts, and emotions.

        <li id="A3">Internal Causes</li>
        <p id="A3">Internal causes of stress can have a profound impact on our well-being, and include negative thought patterns, unmanaged emotions, personality traits like perfectionism and competitiveness, physical health issues, sleep disturbances, and lack of purpose. These internal causes, such as catastrophic thinking, anxiety, anger, fear, chronic illness, pain, discomfort, insomnia, and feeling unfulfilled and uncertain about one's direction in life, can interact and exacerbate one another, creating a complex web of stress that can be challenging to navigate.<u><b>This can be summarised into:</u></b></p>

         <br>
         <li id="A3">External causes</li>
         <p id="A3">External causes of stress can have a significant impact on our well-being, and include work-related stressors such as long hours, heavy workload, office politics, and lack of control, financial stressors like debt, financial insecurity, and unexpected expenses, relationship stressors such as conflicts, communication breakdowns, social isolation, and difficult or toxic relationships, and environmental stressors like noise, pollution, clutter, lack of natural light, and uncomfortable or unsafe living conditions. These external causes can be unpredictable and outside of our control, making them even more challenging to manage, and can interact with internal causes to create a complex web of stress that affects our overall health and well-being.<u>External causes can also be summarised into:</u></p>
