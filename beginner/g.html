        Last stop for a resolution
        End of the line, is it confusion?
        So go, go see what's there for you
        Nothing new, nothing new for you to use
        I've got no new act to amuse you

        I've got no desire to use you, you know
        But anything that I could do, would never be good enough for you
        If you can't help it then just leave it alone
        Leave it alone, yeah, just forget it
        It's really easy

        I believe I'll forget it too
        Still you're keepin' me around
        Til I finally drag us both down
        Streaming feathers out your hat
        Yes I believe that's where it's at
        You belong tagging along
        And I belong in your zoo

        So I wait for confirmation
        That you're never gonna use your starting gun
        Unless its me it sounds like being here just wasn't that much fun
        Anything that I could do
        Would never be good enough for you
        If you can't help it then just leave it alone
        Leave me alone, yeah, just forget it
        It's really easy

         I'll just forget it too
        Coast to coast, coast to coast
        I'll do what I can so you can be what you do
        Coast to coast, coast to coast
        I'll do everything I can so you can be what you do
        Coast to coast, coast to coast

        Circuit rider comes every fifth Sunday
        Oh my Lord, I fell asleep one day
        Anything that I could do
        Is there anything that I could do
        That someone doesn't do for you
        That someone didn't do for HTML paragraphs.html HTML/WhatsApp Image 2024-03-23 at 00.16.17_ec02b99a.jpg HTML/WhatsApp Video 2024-04-27 at 18.10.15_d4e28786.mp4 HTML/WhatsApp Audio 2024-04-27 at 17.51.23_0647ea9a.mp3 HTML/WhatsApp Audio 2024-04-25 at 08.44.44_1f025da0.waptt.opusyou
        That I haven't already done for you
