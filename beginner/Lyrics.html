        Follow Westlife
        on Bandsintown
        An empty street, an empty house


        a hole inside my heart
        I'm all alone, the rooms are getting smaller
        I wonder how, i wonder why
        I wonder where they are
        The days we had, the songs we sang together
        O yea..
        


        And oh my love, I'm holdin on forever
        Reaching for the love that seems so far
        
        


        So I say a little prayer
        And hope my dreams will take me there
        where the skies are blue
        to see you once again my love
        over seas from coast to coast
        to find the place I love the most
        where the fields are green
        to see you once again...my love...
        


        I try to read, I go to work
        I'm laughin with my friends
        but i cant stop to keep myself from thinking..
        oh no
        I wonder how I wonder why
        I wonder where they are
        the days we had, the songs we sang together
        oh yeah...
        


        And oh my love I'm holdin on forever
        Reaching for the love that seems so far
        


        So I say a little prayer
        And hope my dreams will take me there
        where the skies are blue
        to see you once again my love
        over seas from coast to coast
        to find the place I love the most
        where the fields are green
        to see you once again...
        


        To hold you in my arms
        to promise you my love
        to tell you from my heart
        your all I'm thinkin of
        


        I'm reachin for a love that seems so far...
        


        So I say a little prayer
        And hope my dreams will take me there
        where the skies are blue
        to see you once again my love
        over seas from coast to coast
        to find the place I love the most
        where the fields are green
        to see you once again..
        My Love
        

        
        I say a little prayer
        my dreams will take me there
        where the skies are blue
        to see you one again
        over seas from coast to coast
        to find the place I love the most
        where the fields are green
        to see you once again
        my love </pre>
